Hey fellow GitHubbers!

I’ve been working on something exciting: FiBei Greetings! We make heartfelt greeting cards, postcards, stickers, and more to help people stay connected. One of our coolest products is the "Talking Card," which plays music via a QR code—adds a personal touch!

Check us out at www.fibeigreetings.com, and if you’re into e-cards, visit www.fibeidigicards.com. We’ve got a buy one, get one free promo going on right now!

Thank you
